; Function: Main program driver, displays a nice game banner then   ;
;			generates a random int between 0 and 9 and jumps to		;
;			proc from there that corresponds to random int index	;
;			in list of words to guess from							;
;																	;
; Return: None														;
;																	;
; Procedure: Move multiple messages into the EDX register & use the ;
;			 WriteStr Irvine32 library proc to print these all to   ;
;			 the console. Generate rand int with RandomRange proc   ;
;			 & jump to label that corresponds to that rand ints		;
;			 index in our list of words to guess from				;
